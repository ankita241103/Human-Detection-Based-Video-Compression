# Human-Detection-Based-Video-Compression
The project "Human Detection-Based Video Compression" optimizes surveillance video storage using motion detection and a sliding window to filter frames with human activity. YOLOv8 detects humans, preserving their quality, while non-human areas are compressed using Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT).
